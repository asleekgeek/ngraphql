# NGraphQL - GraphQL support for .NET
Initial Draft.
Currently contains full GraphQL grammar based on Irony (https://github.com/IronyProject/Irony)  
To try it, compile the project, fire up GrammarExplorer app from Irony project, load GraphQL grammar from the compiled assembly, and try it with GraphQL files.
